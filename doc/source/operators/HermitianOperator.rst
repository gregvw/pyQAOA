HermitianOperator
=================

Hermitian operators have the property that :math:`H^\ast = H`, which implies that 
the operator has purely real eigenvalues :math:`\sigma(H)\subset\mathbb{R}`. Consequently,
the operator :math:`U_H(\theta)=\exp(i\theta H)` is a unitary operator, provided that 
:math:`\theta\in\mathbb{R}`.
